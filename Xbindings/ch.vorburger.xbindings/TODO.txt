* MUST redo both steps (while re-recording dependencies)

* Lists!
* EMF.xtext

* MUST testBidiBinding & detect infinite loops

* JFace
* master detail type bindings

* manage Exceptions in bindings, set Validation stuff instead of bubbling up

* ch.vorburger.xbindings split in 
		ch.vorburger.xbindings.core
		[ch.vorburger.xbindings.xtend (split needed?!)]
		ch.vorburger.xbindings.aop
			ch.vorburger.xbindings.beans
			ch.vorburger.xbindings.jface
			ch.vorburger.xbindings.emf
				ch.vorburger.xbindings.emf.xtext
	* src/main/java & src/test/java in core
	* pom.xml

* SHOULD sample SWT two text fields bound to same model String property
* SHOULD sample SWT two text fields bound to each other (no model)
* COULD  sample dito in Swing

* COULD EMF without AOP - how to track getters? ask list

* MAY use xtend Processed Annotations thing for something like @Bean with built-in (no AOP) Change and getter access tracking

* WHY lazy evaluation, like JavaFX supports - needed?
* COULD handle field interdependencies and automatically order ???

* COULD apply to JPA, for Queries, like LINQ
